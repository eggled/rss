				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="rss-wrap"> <p>Back in <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/02/ftc-says-it-will-look-into-apples-marketing-of-in-app-purchases-to-kids/">2011</a>, the Federal Trade Commission promised to look into the controls Apple had in place to prevent minors from making in-app purchases on iOS games. It has taken quite a while, but it looks like there's finally movement happening on that front: just shy of four months after a five-year-old in the UK bought <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/03/five-year-old-runs-up-2500-in-app-purchase-tab-with-apple/">$2,500 worth of in-app bling</a>, Apple is releasing details about a <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2013/06/23/apple-notifies-itunes-users-of-in-app-purchase-settlement-details-5-to-those-inappropriately-charged-under-30/">class-action settlement</a> intended to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Details of the settlement can be found on <a href="https://www.itunesinapppurchasesettlement.com/CAClaimForms/AIL/Home.aspx">this site</a> (which, ironically, appears to be programmed in Microsoft ASP.NET and served on Microsoft IIS 7.5):</p>
<blockquote><p>If you are eligible for settlement benefits, you may choose between (a) a single $5 iTunes Store credit or (b) a credit equal to the total amount of Game Currency that a minor charged to your iTunes account without your knowledge or permission within a single forty-five (45) day period, less any refund you previously received. A cash refund in lieu of an iTunes Store credit is available if (a) you no longer have an active iTunes account, or (b) your claims exceed $30 in total. Additional requirements for claiming charges after the forty-five (45) day period apply.</p></blockquote>
<p>In typical class-action fashion, the settlement provides a small amount of remuneration in the form of a $5 iTunes gift card if you claim that a minor purchased less than $30 of unauthorized stuff; if you have more than $30 in unauthorized purchases, the settlement will provide some undefined amount of cash.</p>

 <p>Actress Ellen Page is not in <i>The Last of Us</i>, no matter how much it might look like she is, and she's lashing out publicly at developer Naughty Dog for "ripping off" her likeness for the game.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gxgfx/i_am_actress_ellen_page_amaa/caorlh8">an AMA interview on Reddit</a> last night, Page responded to a question about how Ellie both looks and sounds like Page, "so much so that almost everyone assumed it was you playing the role," according to the questioner. Page responded, "I guess I should be flattered that they ripped off my likeness, but I am actually acting in a video game called <i>Beyond: Two Souls</i>, so it was not appreciated."</p>
<p>It's true: the visual similarities between the real-life Page and the virtual Ellie have confused a <a href="https://twitter.com/ez50864/status/344689364636430336">few</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/JamieScoins/status/346051392147968000">people</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/pspcarlos/status/348958198314696705">on Twitter</a>. Page doesn't want the credit, though, sending one Twitter user toward <a href="https://twitter.com/TheVulcanSalute">Ellie's actual voice and mo-cap actress Ashley Johnson</a> in <a href="https://twitter.com/EllenPage/status/348961670833512449">a response tweet</a> just last night.</p>

  </div>
 <p>You've got an Android phone, an Android tablet, and maybe even an Android laptop, but be honest with yourself: your affection for Google's mobile operating system knows no bounds, and you won't rest until it's powering literally every computer you own. If this description fits you, HP's newly announced Slate 21 is for you. It's a 21.5-inch, 1920×1080 kickstand-toting all-in-one equipped with Nvidia's Tegra 4 SoC and running Android 4.2.2.</p>
<p>We don't know much more about the all-in-one, which was announced this morning at an HP event in Beijing, but according to Engadget's <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/06/24/hp-launches-slate-21-aio/">translated version of the press release</a>, it also includes an HD webcam, integrated speakers, and HP's <a href="http://www.hp.com/global/us/en/wireless/wireless-direct.html">Wireless Direct</a> printing tech. We don't know anything about pricing, availability, or whether the desktop will even come to the US, but CNET <a href="http://asia.cnet.com/hp-slate-21-aio-is-a-21-inch-android-tablet-62221673.htm?src=twt">reports</a> that it will be rolled out to multiple countries eventually.</p>
<p>Perhaps in an effort to offer cheaper machines without expensive Windows licenses or Intel processors, the PC OEMs are increasingly beginning to experiment with Android in form factors one wouldn't normally expect. The HP Slate 21 follows the previously announced <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/ads/x2/slatebook-x2.html">HP Slate x2</a> convertible laptop, which is itself reminiscent of Asus' long-running <a href="http://eee.asus.com/en/transformer-300/features">Transformer Pad</a> series. Asus is also responsible for a few other Android-equipped curios, including both an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/03/asus-1299-transformer-all-in-one-dual-wields-windows-8-and-android/">all-in-one computer</a> and an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/06/two-cpus-two-batteries-two-oses-asus-announces-transformer-book-trio/">upcoming laptop</a> that have full Android tablets inside their detachable screens.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="rss-wrap"> <p>After spending the night in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport, NSA leaker Edward Snowden <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/24/edward-snowden-booked-on-plane-from-moscow-to-havana-live-coverage">did not board</a> the Aeroflot flight he had been expected to take to Havana. His plan was apparently to fly to the Cuban capital and then to go <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/06/with-wikileaks-help-snowden-lands-in-moscow-headed-on-to-democratic-nation/">on to Ecuador (where he had requested asylum)</a>. Snowden's whereabouts remain unknown.</p>
<p>It may be that Snowden and his friends from WikiLeaks—who helped him secure a “special refugee travel document” last week from Ecuadorian authorities and assisted with his trip from Hong Kong to Moscow—have an alternate travel route in mind. There is also the possibility that he is being detained by Russian authorities.</p>
<p>The State Department had revoked Snowden’s American passport on Friday, which is normal for persons with “<a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/06/united-states-charges-snowden-with-espionage-asks-hong-kong-to-arrest-him/">felony arrest warrants</a>.”</p>

 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-6e8b37c8-58b1-d128-4f5a-cbd703767b18">Fifteen years ago, I was living outside Geneva, Switzerland, spending my lunch hours screwing around on the nascent Web a few dozen kilometers from where it was created. I popped into chat rooms, forums, and news sites, and I e-mailed family back home. I was learning French and getting my dose of tech news by reading the French-language edition of <em>Macworld</em> magazine. (<em>Génial</em>!)</p>
<p>I returned Stateside mere months after Ars began, reading more and more about the people behind many of the technologies that I was becoming increasingly fascinated with. I consumed just about every book I could find describing the history and personalities behind graphical user interfaces, networking, the Internet itself, and more.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing I’ve learned through all that, it’s that most people involved in technology continue the Newtonian tradition of humility. The most iconic innovators all seem to readily acknowledge that they stand on the shoulders of giants. In fact, when I met Vint Cerf and thanked him for making the work I do possible, he was a predictable gentleman, saying, “There were many others involved in the creation of TCP/IP, not just me.”</p>

 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-6e8b37c8-6862-c13f-4d20-b634252b39cd">According to <a href="http://www.chetansharma.com/usmarketupdateq12013.htm">new industry data published last week from the mobile phone industry</a>, three major shifts are currently underway in the American cellular landscape. We’re spending record amounts on mobile data, carriers are making <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/06/prepaid-mobile-phone-users-in-america-hit-record-high/">hardly any money off new subscribers (hence the push towards data)</a>, and usage of Internet-based messaging systems is going through the roof.</p>
<p>With that first shift, according to independent analyst Chetan Sharma, mobile data now accounts for “almost 45 percent of the US mobile industry services revenues, and as we had forecasted a few years back, the cross-over point of 50 percent might occur later this year.”</p>
<p>So you’re not just imagining things—your mobile phone bill is creeping upwards. Likely, it’s due to the fact that on your smartphone, you’re using data far more than texting and texting far more than calling.</p>

The news comes after Bitcoin held its <a href="http://www.bitcoin2013.com/">"Future of Payments" conference</a> in San Jose last month.  (The license information is available on <a href="http://dfi.ca.gov/Licensees/money_transmitter/default.html">CA.gov</a> and <em>Forbes</em> placed the cease and desist letter on <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/149335233/CA-State-Cease-and-Desist-May-30">Scribd</a>.)</p>
<p>If found in violation, penalties range from $1,000 to $2,500 per violation per day plus criminal prosecution (which could lead to more fines and possibly imprisonment). Under federal law, it's also a felony "to engage in the business of money transmission without the appropriate state license or failure to register with the US Treasury Department," according to <em>Forbes</em>. Penalties under that law could be up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</p>
<p>Jon Matonis, a member of the Bitcoin Foundation's Board of Directors, wrote up the news for <em>Forbes</em>. Matonis defended the Bitcoin Foundation's actions during its time in California:</p>

		<description><![CDATA[EPA won’t even finalize its draft report as Wyoming takes control.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="rss-wrap"> <p>Last October, Ars published an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/10/epa-fracking-investigation-in-wyoming-revisited-after-objections/">update</a> to a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2011/12/how-the-epa-linked-fracking-to-contaminated-well-water/">US EPA investigation</a> linking natural gas production to groundwater contamination in Wyoming. On Thursday, the EPA <a href="http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/0/DC7DCDB471DCFE1785257B90007377BF">announced</a> that it will step back from the investigation, ceding leadership to the State of Wyoming.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://deq.state.wy.us/">Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality</a> and the <a href="http://wogcc.state.wy.us/">Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission</a> will further investigate groundwater conditions around Pavillion with support from the EPA, according to the press release. The scope of the investigation will be more limited, however. It'll now focus on a select number of private wells rather than larger questions about the possibility of gas production and hydraulic fracking impacts in shallow and deep groundwater. The State plans to additionally sample fourteen water supply wells, analyze existing data on the cement seals in gas production wells within a quarter mile of those water wells, and search for records of previous wastewater pits used to hold fracking fluid in that area. The results are scheduled to be finalized and released in September 2014.</p>
<p>Some of that work will be paid for with funds from a $1.5 million grant that Encana, the gas exploration company operating in Pavillion, is giving to the <a href="http://www.conservewy.com/wnrf/">Wyoming Natural Resource Foundation</a>.</p>

 <p>New York City noise blares right outside Tumblr’s office in the Flat Iron District in Manhattan. Once inside, the headquarters hum with a quiet intensity. I am surrounded by four dogs that employees have brought to the workspace today. Apparently, there are even more dogs lurking somewhere behind the perpendicular rows of desks. What makes the whole thing even spookier is that these dogs don’t bark or growl. It’s like someone’s told them that there are developers and designers at work, and somehow they’ve taken the cue.</p>
<p>I’m here to see Tumblr’s Creative Director Peter Vidani, who is going to pull the curtain back on the design process and user experience at Tumblr. And when I say design process, I don’t just mean color schemes or typefaces. I am here to see the process of interaction design: how the team at Tumblr comes up with ideas for the user interface on its website and its mobile apps. I want to find out how those ideas are shaped by their engineering team into a final product.</p>
<p>Back in May, Yahoo announced it was <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/05/yahoo-will-purchase-tumblr-for-1-1-billion-according-to-wsj-report/">acquiring Tumblr for $1.1 billion</a>. Yahoo indicated that Tumblr would continue to operate independently, though we will probably see a lot of content crossover between the millions of blog posts hosted by Tumblr and Yahoo’s search engine technology. It’s a little known fact that Yahoo has provided some useful tools for UX professionals and developers over the years through their <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/">Design Pattern Library</a>, which shares some of Yahoo’s most successful and time-tested UI touches and interactions with Web developers. It’s probably too early to tell if Tumblr’s UI elements will filter back into these libraries. In the meantime, I talked to Vidani about how Tumblr UI features come to life.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[He'll make due on his inaugural address by sharing how the US can "lead global efforts."]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="rss-wrap"> <figure class="video" style="width:640px"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gcL3_zzgWeU#?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0"></iframe><div class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">
<div class="caption-text">At the top of WhiteHouse.gov today, "Take Action on Climate Change."</div> </div></figure><p>On Tuesday at Georgetown University, President Barack Obama plans to make due on his biggest promise from the 2013 inaugural address. "In my inaugural address, I pledged that America would respond to the growing threat of climate change for our children and future generations," the president states in a new video on WhiteHouse.gov. So this week, he'll lay out his vision of where the US needs to go with "a national plan to reduce carbon pollution, prep our country for the impacts of climate change, and lead global efforts to fight it."</p>
<p>Obama <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/us/politics/climate-change-prominent-in-obamas-inaugural-address.html?_r=0">made headlines</a> back in January for, among other things, making a bold, public promise for climate change policy. He devoted eight sentences of his inauguration speech to climate change—more than any other topic noted the <em>New York Times—</em>and did not sugarcoat it at the time. “Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science," Obama said. "But none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms.”</p>
<p>In this new teaser video, Obama recognizes that "n<strong></strong>o single step that can reverse the effects of climate change." He makes reference to the need for collaborative work from scientists and farmers, engineers and businesses, and all US citizens and employees alike. However, the video doesn't reveal any specifics. It leads to the <a href="http://whitehouse.gov/climate-change">WhiteHouse.gov/climate-change</a> page, which does the same.</p>

 <p>In my <a title="Get Lamp Review" href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/09/the-great-thing-about/">review of <em>Get Lamp</em></a>, the documentary about text adventures, I mentioned that the original Infocom employees believed the market for these games could exist for hundreds of years. After all, the novel is still around today and, despite stiff competition from movies and video games, writing fiction is still a profitable endeavor. Why not interactive fiction?</p>
<p>The reality, however, is that since the demise of Infocom in 1989, many people have tried to make interactive fiction into a commercial endeavor. None have been able to figure out how to make the financial side work—until recently. Everything changed with the rise of smartphones and tablets.</p>
<h2>A new platform, a new type of game</h2>
<p>Michael Berlyn was an “implementor” at Infocom in the early 1980s and was responsible for hit games such as <em>Suspended</em> and <em>Infidel</em>. He left the company in 1984 before it imploded and went on to a successful career in game design and consulting. Berlyn created the <em>Bubsy</em> side-scrolling games on the Sega Genesis and contributed to <em>Syphon Filter</em> on the original PlayStation. He later retired from the industry and moved to Florida with his wife, Muffy. But when he saw the first iPhone, he knew there was a chance to create something new.</p>

 <p>For many low-volume Kenyan farmers, the only source of information about the market rate for crops comes from the very people who are trying to buy them. The lack of pricing transparency means that farmers don't always get the best deal. <a href="http://mfarm.co.ke/about">MFarm</a> seeks to solve this problem by providing up-to-date market prices via an app or SMS direct to farmers. It also connects farmers with buyers directly, cutting out the middlemen.</p>
<p>MFarm's CEO is Jamila Abass, a 29-year-old computer scientist from Kenya. She founded MFarm in 2010 after reading about how farmers have been "oppressed for decades and disconnected in terms of information."</p>
<p>"Many farmers only have the produce but don't have the means to market their produce themselves," Abass told Wired.co.uk. "They have to rely on middlemen who show up and give them both the price and the buyer. They have no information and no alternative market. We wanted to close that information gap between the farmers and the market."</p>

 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-6e8b37c8-716a-1bde-727e-ba456b9d7b0e">Just two days after the United States government <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/06/united-states-charges-snowden-with-espionage-asks-hong-kong-to-arrest-him/">criminally charged</a> Edward Snowden with espionage and other crimes, the infamous whistleblower is on the move. On Sunday, the former NSA contractor left Hong Kong on a commercial flight, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23021767">landed in Moscow</a>, and was reportedly <a href="https://twitter.com/KiritRadia_ABC/statuses/348803037378269185">picked up</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/WilliamsJon/statuses/348794144321318912">Venezuelan diplomats</a> in the Russian capital.</p>
<p>Snowden’s travel is being <a href="http://wikileaks.org/WikiLeaks-Statement-On-Edward.html">assisted by WikiLeaks</a>, and he is still in transit to a “democratic nation”—possibly Venezuela or Ecuador. <a href="https://twitter.com/AkikoFujita/status/348824572243628033">ABC News reports</a> that Snowden's US passport was revoked on Saturday. A senior American government official told the news network, "We have little idea how he left Hong Kong." That could suggest Snowden has secured travel documents, such as a temporary passport or a <a href="http://bit.ly/12bdtXo"><em>laissez-passer</em></a>, from another country.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 11:43am CT</strong>: Ricardo Patino, the foreign minister of Ecuador, <a href="https://twitter.com/RicardoPatinoEC/status/348841761684197378">wrote on Twitter</a>: "The Government of Ecuador has received an asylum request from Edward J. Snowden."</p>

 <p>Ever since <em>The Guardian</em> leaked a top secret court order allowing the National Security Agency (NSA) to collect the telephone metadata belonging to all Verizon customers, daily, for a period of three months, more and more has been revealed about the way the NSA works and how it gathers information. The most recent information comes from a document called "Minimization Procedures Used by the National Security Agency in Connection with Acquisitions of Foreign Intelligence." It reveals that the NSA will retain anonymized and encrypted e-mail and instant messages, whether or not the messages come from people within the US.</p>
<p>Dan Goodin gave us all the details in his article <b><a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/06/use-of-tor-and-e-mail-crypto-could-increase-chances-that-nsa-keeps-your-data/">Use of Tor and e-mail crypto could increase chances that NSA keeps your data</a></b>. Naturally Ars commenters, no strangers to using Tor and encryption in their e-mails, had strong opinions on this topic.</p>

 <p><em><i>This Q&amp;A is part of a weekly series of posts highlighting common questions encountered by technophiles and answered by users at <a href="http://stackexchange.com/?source=ars1">Stack Exchange</a>, a free, community-powered network of <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites?source=ars2">100+ Q&amp;A sites</a>.</i></em></p>
<p>Stack Exchange user and C# developer <strong><a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/81106/george-powell%22">George Powell</a></strong> tries hard to follow the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY principle</a>. But as any good dev knows, it's not always possible, or even optimal, to stay original. <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/q/193415/81106">Powell writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Often I write small methods (maybe 10 to 15 lines of code) that need to be reused across two projects that can't reference each other. The method might be something to do with networking / strings / <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mvvm">MVVM</a> etc. and is a generally useful method not specific to the project it originally sits in.</p></blockquote>
<p>So how should you track shared snippets across projects so you know where your canonical code resides and know where it's in production when a bug needs to be fixed?</p>

 <p>In this episode of the Technicast, we look back at the announcements from E3 last week. Gaming Editor <a href="http://arstechnica.com/author/kyle-orland/">Kyle Orland</a> and Senior Products Specialist <a href="http://arstechnica.com/author/andrew_cunningham/">Andrew Cunningham</a> were on site at the event, and they joined co-host <a href="http://arstechnica.com/author/caseyjohnston/">Casey Johnston</a> and I to provide some analysis on announcements. We got our coffee ready, fired up Skype, and got down to recording.</p>
<p>But then a funny thing happened. A couple of hours after we finished the episode, Microsoft announced that it was <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/06/rumor-microsoft-set-to-reverse-controversial-game-licensing-policies/">reversing its stance</a> on used games in the Xbox One. (Kyle wrote about <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/06/xbox-one-eighty-microsoft-fails-to-sell-the-future-retreats-to-the-past/">some of its implications</a> afterward.)</p>
<p>So, the four of us reunited back on Skype for an additional recording. We <em>had</em> to address this 180-degree turn by Microsoft during the podcast.</p>

 <p><strong>The true danger of climate change: shrinking bison.</strong> And things could get pricey if cows follow suit. This is the first time we here at Weird Science have seen a dataset quantified in terms of bison heads, but a sample size of a quarter-million is pretty good for most studies. Those quarter million bison were distributed across North America, allowing the researchers to see how the animals fared in various conditions. The conclusion is that <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0067065">bison are not among the some who like it hot</a>.</p>
<p>Although they can handle short term hot spells ("little effect of high temperatures on bison performance is observed"), they were generally smaller in regions that consistently experienced hot temperatures. (So, it's probably safe to watch your bison on a hot cycle, but don't let it have long sessions in the sauna.) The authors estimate that, if commercial cattle showed a similar pattern of shrinkage, each 1°C increase in temperatures would cost farmers a billion dollars.</p>

 <p>If a 24-hour radio broadcast happens in a Scottish forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?</p>
<p>At the end of August, an FM transmitter will be set up in the middle of the Galloway Forest to broadcast music from dozens of artists over the course of 24 hours. Those who want to hear it will have to head to the forest. There will be no repeats, and the files will be deleted after they are played.</p>
<p>The installation is the brainchild of "noise terrorist" Stuart McLean (aka <a href="http://frenchbloke.tumblr.com/">Frenchbloke</a>) and artists in residence at Galloway Forest <a href="http://www.thedarkoutside.com/index.php/about/">Robbie Coleman and Jo Hodges</a>. Galloway Forest is the UK's first "dark sky park," recognized by the Dark Sky Association. This is an award given for places with low levels of light pollution that are well-suited for stargazing.</p>

 <p>On Friday, two Icelandic activists with previous connections to WikiLeaks announced that they received newly unsealed court orders from Google. Google sent the orders earlier in the week, revealing that the company searched and seized data from their Gmail accounts—likely as a result of a grand jury investigation into the rogue whistleblower group.</p>
<p>Google was forbidden under American law from disclosing these orders to the men until the court lifted this restriction in early May 2013. (A Google spokesperson referred Ars to its <a href="https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/userdatarequests/faq/">Transparency Report</a> for an explanation of its policies.)</p>
<p>On June 21, 2013, well-known Irish-Icelandic <a href="http://www.smarimccarthy.is/about/">developer</a> Smári McCarthy <a href="http://www.smarimccarthy.is/2013/06/the-dragnet-at-the-edge-of-forever/">published his recently un-sealed court order</a> dating back to July 14, 2011. Google sent him the order, which included McCarthy's Gmail account metadata, the night before. The government cited the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored_Communications_Act">Stored Communications Act</a> (SCA)(specifically a <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2703">2703(d)</a> order) as grounds to provide this order.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="rss-wrap"> <p>I don’t know if you guys heard, but a <em>very</em> important update for Instagram just hit yesterday. Facebook <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/06/instagram-hopes-15-seconds-will-be-better-than-six-for-social-micro-video/">announced</a> that the service now supports <em>15 seconds of video</em>—actually, just kidding. Despite the hulabaloo on the Internet, Instagram's new feature wasn't the only app news to hit this week. To get you geared up for the weekend, we’ll briefly look at Dolphin Browser’s new update, Rockmelt’s socially integrated Flipboard-like features, and Push Bullet, which pushes content directly to your phone. We’ll also take a look at Aviary’s new UI and enhancement features—an app you might want to consider if you’re exhausted by the Instagram press tour making the rounds this week.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="rss-wrap"> <p>Facebook engineers have fixed a privacy bug that disclosed e-mail addresses and phone numbers of about 6 million account holders to other users, company officials said Friday.</p>
<p>The inadvertent disclosure was included in archives generated when people used the Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/download.your.information">Download Your Information tool</a>. The service allows users to acquire the entire contents of their accounts. In some cases, the archives contained private e-mail addresses and phone numbers belonging to people the account holder had searched for on Facebook. In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-security/important-message-from-facebooks-white-hat-program/10151437074840766">blog post published Friday</a>, company representatives wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>We currently have no evidence that this bug has been exploited maliciously and we have not received complaints from users or seen anomalous behavior on the tool or site to suggest wrongdoing. Although the practical impact of this bug is likely to be minimal since any email address or phone number that was shared was shared with people who already had some of that contact information anyway, or who had some connection to one another, it's still something we're upset and embarrassed by, and we'll work doubly hard to make sure nothing like this happens again.

 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-6e8b37c8-68e4-43c4-f8bf-f865a979e758">On Friday, former <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-charges-snowden-with-espionage/2013/06/21/507497d8-dab1-11e2-a016-92547bf094cc_story.html">NSA contractor Edward Snowden was formally charged</a> by the United States government with espionage, theft, and conversion of government property in a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/716865-snowden-complaint.html">sealed criminal complaint in the Eastern District Court of Virginia</a>. According to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-charges-snowden-with-espionage/2013/06/21/507497d8-dab1-11e2-a016-92547bf094cc_story.html">the <em>Washington Post</em></a> citing anonymous sources, the United States has also asked Hong Kong to detain Snowden on a “provisional arrest warrant.”</p>
<p>Snowden, of course, famously leaked a series of documents to <em>The Guardian</em> and <em>The Washington Post</em>—and continues to do so. On Friday, the UK-based paper revealed that a British spy agency has been involved in <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/06/new-leaks-british-intels-direct-from-fiber-taps-worse-than-the-us/">tapping communications directly from fiber optic cables</a> passing through the United Kingdom, based on documents Snowden provided.</p>
<p>Some Hong Kong legal watchers though, have <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/asia-pacific/china/130610/why-edward-snowden-hong-kong-extradition-asylum">wondered if Snowden’s fleeing to Hong Kong was a better choice</a> than it might seem at first blush. Apparently, the High Court in the quasi-city-state has issued an order requiring the government to create a new procedure to consider asylum applications. Until such a procedure is achieved, asylum seekers can ostensibly stay indefinitely.</p>

 <p>Though Android phones are rarely updated as quickly as their fruit-flavored competitors, Samsung at least makes a respectable effort to keep its old hardware running reasonably with modern software. Its <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/04/samsung-galaxy-s-4-the-empire-strikes-back-with-a-faster-sleeker-handset/">Galaxy S 4</a> was one of the first non-Nexus devices we saw running Android 4.2.2 (which as of this writing is the most recent version of Android), and now the old Galaxy S III is getting ready to join the fun.</p>
<p>We've <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/05/galaxy-s-iii-may-get-an-s-4-style-makeover/">known since May</a> that an Android 4.2 update for Samsung's 2012 flagship device was in the works, but now it looks like SamMobile <a href="http://www.sammobile.com/2013/06/21/exclusive-i9300xxufme7-android-4-2-2-jelly-bean-leaked-firmware-for-the-galaxy-s-iii/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=exclusive-i9300xxufme7-android-4-2-2-jelly-bean-leaked-firmware-for-the-galaxy-s-iii">got its hands on</a> what appears to be an official, near-final build of the software. As expected, it appears to backport a number of Android and TouchWiz features from the Galaxy S 4, including the improved S Voice and other voice control features, new lock screen animations, new screen color presets, and more. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/11/review-android-4-2-is-a-sweeter-tasting-jelly-bean/">Android 4.2</a> features like Daydream and the new Quick Settings pull-down menu will also make their way over.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the version of the update SamMobile is working with is for the i9300 variant of the S III—that is, the international version equipped with the Exynos 4 Quad SoC, and not the US version with its dual-core Snapdragon S4 Plus. Features and availability may differ based on the phone you have and the carrier you're with.</p>

 <p>Device-disabling malware that masquerades as legitimate antivirus protection is migrating to smartphones running Google's Android operating system, according to researchers who got their hands on what appears to be an early test version of one such malicious program.</p>
<p>So-called Fake AV software, which is often bundled with screensavers or other innocuous-appearing apps, has long been a nuisance in the malware landscape for both the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/01/blackhole-dominates-web-malware-attacks-says-sophos/">Microsoft Windows</a> and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/05/fake-mac-defender-antivirus-app-scams-users-for-money-cc-numbers/">Mac OS X</a> platforms. Some operators have managed to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/11/how-the-most-massive-botnet-scam-ever-made-millions-for-estonian-hackers/">rake in millions of dollars</a> by reporting non-existent infections on machines and then tricking owners into paying for fraudulent disinfection services.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2013-060301-4418-99">Android Fakedefender</a>, which researchers from antivirus provider Symantec recently discovered in several third-party Android app markets. The malicious app is still buggy and crude to say the least, but it nonetheless has the ability to create major headaches for smartphone users who install it. On many handsets, for instance, Fakedefender cannot be uninstalled at all and will prevent users from performing factory resets. Borrowing a page from <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/11/mushrooming-growth-of-ransomware-extorts-5-million-a-year/">so-called ransomware malware</a>, the app also prevents many users from opening other apps or accessing data stored on the device until users buy a premium version of the Fake AV program.</p>

<p>It’s Friday, and what better way to end the work week than with a leak from Google? Apparently, the search giant is preparing to <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2013/06/google-mine.html">launch</a> a new service, integrated into Google Plus, that will help you get rid of your stuff. It’s called Google Mine, and it will purportedly help users share their actual, tangible belongings with friends and keep track of what those friends are sharing, too.</p>
<p>The Google Operating System blog, an unofficial blog that tracks what’s happening with Google, writes that the company is working on the service internally. Users will reportedly be able to enter information about any object they want to share and then label those objects as “lent,” “given away,” “got it back,” “lost it,” or “had in the past.” They can then post a video about the object, write a review, add it to a wishlist, or link others to buy it with their Google Shopping accounts. There is also a control where your Google+ circles can see the items you’re putting up for grabs and a 3D viewer called Katamari that uses WebGL to display 360-degree views of objects.</p>
<p>The service sounds a bit like Google’s version of Craigslist, with the company’s social network thrown into the mix. Apparently, the service's Android app is also making the rounds within Google’s internal Play store.</p>
