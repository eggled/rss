- javascript for determining "already loaded" can go away... append a child node (replace if it exists)
- Need sorting by date, it does it by guid now
- Want to respond to Ctl-C.
- manip.m is way too sensitive to undefined globals
- onpageload should scroll to the top, probably.
- add a refresh link that forces a re-download of the feeds
- it's iterating all articles, should only be iterating an "unread" index (perf)
