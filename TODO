- javascript for determining "already loaded" can go away... append a child node (replace if it exists)
- Need sorting by date, it probably does it by source then date
- Description (at least for abstruse goose) contains the actual content I want...
- Want to respond to Ctl-C.
- manip.m is way too sensitive to undefined globals
- onpageload should scroll to the top, probably.
- add a refresh link that forces a re-download of the feeds
