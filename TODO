- javascript for determining "already loaded" can go away... append a child node (replace if it exists)
- onpageload should scroll to the top, probably.
- refresh link should reload the display pane
- would be nice to support an import of an opml file
- want to replace navbar items with titles, which can be downloaded.
- need a "mark unread" button
