- javascript for determining "already loaded" can go away... append a child node (replace if it exists)
- Want to respond to Ctl-C.
- manip.m is way too sensitive to undefined globals
- onpageload should scroll to the top, probably.
- add a refresh link that forces a re-download of the feeds
- description can get big... that should go in a file, like content.
- javascript refresh after adding a url needs work (needs to refresh the main page, it's also adding scrollbars every time I pop a new navbar on there... whoops.)
- apparently, some feeds are not sending a guid
- also, would be nice to support an import of an opml file
