- javascript for determining "already loaded" can go away... append a child node (replace if it exists)
- Want to respond to Ctl-C.
- manip.m is way too sensitive to undefined globals
- onpageload should scroll to the top, probably.
- refresh link should reload the display pane
- would be nice to support an import of an opml file
- want a date appended to the entries
