 <p>The vast majority of sites that push malware on their visitors are legitimate online services that have been hacked as opposed to those hosted by attackers for the purposes of distributing malicious software, Google security researchers said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The data, included for the first time as part of the <a href="http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/safebrowsing">safe browsing section</a> of Google's regular transparency report, further challenges the myth that malware attacks happen only on disreputable sites, such as those that peddle porn, illicit software ("warez"), and similar content. For instance, on June 9 only 3,891 of the sites Google blocked as part of its <a href="http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2012/06/safe-browsing-protecting-web-users-for.html">Safe Browsing program</a> were dedicated malware sites, while the remaining 39,247 sites that were filtered offered legitimate services that had been compromised.</p>
<p>In all, Google blocks about 10,000 sites per day as part of the program, which is designed to help people using Firefox, Chrome, and other participating browsers to steer clear of phishing scams and drive-by malware attacks. The program is also designed to inform webmasters of infections hitting their site and to take steps to fix the problems. In all, the Safe Browsing program helps protect about 1 billion people per day.</p>

<p>Adding yet another phone-tablet hybrid to the pile, Sony has <a href="http://blogs.sonymobile.com/press_release/the-new-xperia-z-ultra-the-worlds-slimmest-and-largest-full-hd-smartphone-display/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-new-xperia-z-ultra-the-worlds-slimmest-and-largest-full-hd-smartphone-display">announced </a>the dustproof and waterproof successor to its Xperia Z series. The Xperia Z Ultra is bigger and comes with one of Qualcomm's latest processors, though we're not sure when we'll see it in the US.</p>
<p>The Xperia Z Ultra is bigger than its 5-inch sibling, with a 6.4-inch display and 1080p resolution. Sony says the phone-tablet hybrid weighs about 212 grams, though it manages to maintain a svelte chassis at only 6.5 mm thickness. It also features a 3000 mAh battery pack to power that large display, in addition to a 2.2GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor, 2GB of RAM, and 4G LTE connectivity, though no specific band has been mentioned. Additionally, there is 16GB of onboard storage available and a microSD slot for an additional storage of up to 64GB.</p>
<p>Those interested in taking the "phablet" underwater will also be pleased to know that the Xperia Z Ultra features IP55 and IP58 waterproofing, which makes it just a little more resilient than its predecessors. It will also feature Android 4.2 Jelly Bean right out of box, in addition to a slew of other software features like Sony's movie, music, and PlayStation apps. You can also use it to snap photos with its 8-megapixel rear-facing camera and 2-megapixel front-facing camera.</p>

 <p>This week, Microsoft is unveiling the previews for its Windows "Blue" operating systems—the Windows 8.1 client, Windows Server 2012 R2, and an update to Windows Server Essentials.  Last night, Microsoft released the previews through its MSDN and TechNet programs for its server platforms, which include a feature called "Desktop Experience"—an add-on which gives the server versions of the platform the same interface as Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>As a result, Microsoft has tipped its hand about some of the interface changes it will be showing in the preview of the client, which it will release later this week. Here's a quick look at the most significant changes in the interface we've found in our first hands-on with the preview revisions.</p>

 <p><em>World of Warcraft</em> publisher Blizzard has temporarily closed mobile access to its online auction house following reports that hackers were using it to scam users out of large amounts of digital gold.</p>
<p>"There's been a recent increase in unauthorized <em>World of Warcraft</em> account-logins via our website and the <em>World of Warcraft</em> mobile armory app," Blizzard officials warned in a <a href="http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/10310774/Account_Security_Warning-25_06_2013">blog post published Tuesday morning</a>. The company is in the process of notifying users who show signs of account compromise and who didn't use a two-factor "authenticator" to help secure connections. Those users will receive instructions for resetting their accounts and be eligible to have their raided gold restored.</p>
<p>The temporary closure comes three days after reports surfaced that unauthorized purchases were being made against user accounts at highly inflated prices. "The items purchased were two brawler white quality items and a white quality level 1 axe," one <em>WoW</em> player wrote <a href="http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9344634977?page=1">here</a>. "I have an authenticator and a relatively difficult password. What could have happened, and what recourse do I have? Will I ever see my gold again?" The items purchased were a brawler's vest for 135,423g, a worn battleaxe for 53,142g, and brawler's pants for 19,660g.</p>

 <p>Sony has a long history of producing handsome products, but the company has had some trouble gaining market share. According to analyst <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2482816">reports</a>, it's been trailing behind most handset manufacturers, despite the launch of its Xperia Z and ZL smartphones. But it's latest device, the Xperia Tablet Z, could help the give the company a bit of a boost, at least in the tablet sector.</p>
<p>The Xperia Tablet Z is Sony's diamond in the rough. It’s a beautiful tablet with clean lines and a feather-light chassis. It makes devices like Apple’s fourth-generation iPad feel antiquated just by its weight alone. But looks and feel aren't the only factors that can carry a gadget through to success. In Sony’s case, it’s competing in a market teeming with OEMs that are in a race to the bottom—the idea being that the cheapest tablet could sell the most units. But Sony is taking the opposite approach by producing a higher-end tablet at a premium price (a $500 price-point, to be exact). It's always been Sony's<em> modus operandi</em> to offer stylish products at a higher price than others, but whether it will be successful in the Android market remains to be seen. Will Sony see success with the Tablet Z? Let's find out.</p>

<p>The Xperia Tablet Z is a 10.1-inch beauty. It has some professional flair with its all-black casing, but its thin chassis gives it a youthful look. There is also a bit of space in between the screen and the edge of the body, so you can pick up the tablet without worrying that you'll accidentally activate something on-screen. When you turn off the screen, the difference between the screen and the edge of the tablet are indistinguishable, which is just another example of Sony's subtle design prowess.</p>

Microsoft will focus on Windows 8.1, which will scale back some of the radical changes that came with Windows 8 and return Microsoft’s customers to somewhat more familiar territory.</p>
<p>The key change will be the return of the Start button, which disappeared on Windows 8 in favor of a hot-corner shortcut to the Metro interface. This is either a major relief for consumers or a case of Microsoft <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/05/microsoft-should-stick-to-its-guns-and-keep-the-start-button-gone/">folding when it should have been holding</a>.</p>

<p>Facebook Home has elicited <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/04/htc-first-review-dont-call-it-the-facebook-phone/">negative reactions</a> from the get-go, to the point that Facebook publicly acknowledged the problems and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/05/facebook-plans-on-fixing-home-so-that-android-users-feel-wait-for-it-at-home/">promised fixes</a>, including the addition of a dock feature that wouldn’t leave Android users so far adrift. AT&amp;T dropped the price on the phone less than a month after release. Reportedly, Samsung responded to Facebook’s offer to collaborate on its own Home phone with, “<a href="http://9to5google.com/2013/06/18/samsung-reportedly-declines-zuckerbergs-request-to-work-on-the-next-facebook-phone/">thanks, but we’re good</a>.”</p>
<p>While AT&amp;T did manage to sell out of the phone, it is neither reporting sales numbers nor indicating whether it plans to restock. The rumors of returned stock to HTC came alongside whispers that the phone would be <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/05/facebook-home-flagship-phone-htc-first-may-be-discontinued/">discontinued entirely</a> once remaining stock was dealt with. If this were the last of the First, we wouldn't be surprised: it's more than enough turmoil for one phone in just shy of two and a half months of existence.</p>

Now, there are some signs that Microsoft is loosening its tight grip on its gaming properties, allowing a mobile reboot of <i>Age of Empires</i> to show up on iOS and Android devices first.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time a Microsoft game has appeared on a non-Windows mobile device. Games like <i>Wordament</i> and <i>Kinectimals</i> have appeared on other platforms, and second-party titles like <i>Ms. Splosion Man</i> have made their way to non-Windows phones after a period of Microsoft exclusivity. Plenty of companion apps for Xbox 360 and Windows games, including <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/06/xbox-360-smartglass-turns-phone-or-tablet-into-second-controller/">Microsoft's Smartglass features</a>, also work on other mobile phones and tablets.</p>
<p>Still, <i>Age of Empires</i> is one of Microsoft's best-known franchises, one that <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/24/4461272/microsoft-xbox-pc-games-to-ios-and-android-age-of-empires">Polygon reports</a> the company is licensing to Japanese developer KLab for a free-to-play version that will come to iOS and Android first, with a Windows Phone version only coming later. It's not that surprising that KLab would make that platform choice, considering that Windows Phone has less than 2 percent of the overall mobile market, compared to a combined 84 percent for iOS and Android (according to <a href="http://www.netmarketshare.com/">NetMarketShare Web browser tracking data</a>). What's more surprising is that Microsoft would <i>let</i> the developer make that decision with one of its biggest exclusive properties.</p>

  </div>
 <p>Last November, an oddball news story caught attention around the world. A research vessel in the Coral Sea, northeast of Australia, discovered that a small island on the map didn’t actually, well, <i>exist</i>. It wasn’t a victim of sea level rise or a David Copperfield illusion—there just wasn’t anything there. A lot of the news coverage at the time was (quite appropriately) of the “Gee—whaddya know?” variety, but the researchers who “undiscovered” (<i>de-scovered?</i>) Sandy Island recently published a paper in <i>Eos </i>detailing answers to deeper questions—how did the island get on the map in the first place and what can we learn from its undiscovery?</p>
<p>The vessel, the RV <i>Southern Surveyor</i>, wasn’t out checking on islands to make sure they were still there. As University of Sydney PhD student Sabin Zahirovic told Ars, the research <a href="http://www.earthbyte.org/">group</a> on board was collecting measurements of the seafloor to aid in piecing together the plate tectonic history of the Coral Sea region, which is poorly understood. That included things like seafloor depth, magnetism (magnetic signatures are locked into the rock as it cools from magma at mid-ocean ridges), gravity measurements (which detect variations in rock density), and good old-fashioned rock samples.</p>
<p>It was with that work on their mind that they noticed something odd. “Close to New Caledonia, we noticed this blob that represented Sandy Island on our scientific charts,” Zahirovic said. “At that time we were unaware of the island's name because it did not appear in the main navigational chart, but only in our scientific charts and cached version of Google Earth.”</p>

 <p>There’s a saying—"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_ain%27t_no_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch">there’s no such thing as a free lunch</a>." On the Web, however, it sure <em>seems</em> like there is. In the time span of a lunch break, a few keywords in a search engine promise free entertainment, just several clicks away. We all know the catch, though. These freebies can come with freeloading adware, malware, and other unwanted programs and plugins. This was particularly true in the Internet’s early days, but in the past decade, tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo—the three major players in search today—have deployed significant resources to prevent adware and malware from compromising their Web browsers, e-mail services, and websites. It can't be that bad in 2013, right?</p>
<p>Answering this question required a little experiment, one inspired by the documentary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_size_me"><em>Super-Size Me</em></a>. That film chronicles Morgan Spurlock’s month-long fast food “diet” during which he limited his exercise and knowledge about healthy eating, had to order everything on the McDonald’s menu at least once, and never said no to an upgrade offer.</p>

<p>The Web version of this is simpler and better for an individual's (physical) health. From a clean computer fresh off an OS install, enter some of the most popular, plausible generic free keyword searches on a popular Web browser. Next, open all of the links in the search results (ads and otherwise) and download the first thing on the landing pages, recording where it went and what it did. Like Spurlock, I would limit my knowledge about what was safe or risky and take no (Internet) precautions beyond the default settings. The same rules applied for installing the program afterward. And in the Web's version of "would you like to super-size that?" I had to say yes to whatever was offered. There would be no avoiding a Web culture of excess and extras.</p>

<blockquote><p>Xbox One does not include a pack-in headset accessory. Each Xbox One includes the new Kinect sensor, with a highly sensitive multi-array microphones designed to enable voice inputs and chat as a system-level capability, both in-game and with Skype and other experiences.

<p><b>ORIGINAL STORY</b></p>

 <p>For the most part, crop rotation—planting different produce in different years—is advertised as a way of helping the soil by keeping a single crop from draining it of some types of nutrients. But it turns out that crop rotation can also help control some agricultural pests. Many pests are specialized feeders that grow on a limited number of plants. Place a distantly related species in the same field, and the pests find themselves with nothing to eat. By the time the original crop rotates back into the field, the bugs that specialize in feeding on it are long since dead.</p>
<p>This approach helped effectively control the western corn rootworm. As its name implies, the animal specializes in eating corn (as the name <em>doesn't</em> imply, it's actually a beetle). By alternating corn and soybeans in the same field, the corn rootworm ended up spending every other year with nothing to eat, keeping its numbers in check. Unfortunately, Illinois has seen the appearance of a "rotation resistant" strain, which is now spreading more widely across the US.</p>
<p>How does an insect become resistant to the fact that its normal meal vanishes? Scientists are beginning to crack the problem, and they're finding it's a combination of changes in the corn rootworm itself, plus changes to the ecosystem it carries along in its gut.</p>

 <p>Apple's <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/06/new-haswell-based-macbook-airs-offer-faster-graphics-all-day-battery-life/">2013 MacBook Air</a> doesn't look like much of an upgrade from the outside, but the story is different on the inside. We've spent the better part of a week using the new Air and measuring just how <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/06/the-u-is-for-ultrabook-intels-low-power-dual-core-haswell-cpus-unveiled/">Intel's new Haswell processors</a>, the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/06/ifixit-finds-a-plethora-of-minor-tweaks-inside-the-2013-macbook-air/">PCI Express-based SSD</a>, and the 802.11ac Wi-Fi adapter change the laptop compared to last year's model.</p>
<p>The new Wi-Fi chip was the change that I was the most eager to get my hands on. I'm always looking to boost my network speeds, but I've been waiting for hardware based on the new 802.11ac standard to become more widely available before upgrading everything on my network. Reviewing both the new Air and Apple's new 802.11ac-capable Airport Express Base Station simultaneously would give me a chance to see just how close the lauded "Gigabit Wi-Fi" would come to fulfilling its promises. I was unpleasantly surprised by the results.</p>
<p>Both the 2012 and 2013 MacBook Airs use four antennas to transmit data—two to send data and two to receive it. Each set of antennas can theoretically send and receive 150Mbps (or 18.75MBps) using 5GHz 802.11n for a total of 300Mbps (37.5MBps). Under 802.11ac, the size of each stream is increased to 433Mbps, making for a maximum theoretical link speed of 866Mbps (108.25MBps) in the 2013 MacBook Air. Actual network transfer speeds rarely (if ever) come within spitting distance of these theoretical maximums, but we would at least expect the actual 802.11ac transfer speeds to increase by a similar percentage compared to 802.11n.</p>

So no one really knows just how much personally identifiable information is available by clicking on the right link to <a href="http://pastebin.com/">Pastebin</a>, <a href="http://pastie.org/">Pastie</a>, or similar sites. Using a platform that runs on the hobbyist <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> platform to drink from this fire hose, a security researcher has cataloged more than 3,000 such posts in less than three months while adding scores more each week.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dumpmon">Dumpmon</a>, as the <a href="http://raidersec.blogspot.com/2013/03/introducing-dumpmon-twitter-bot-that.html">project is called</a>, is a bot that monitors Twitter messages for Web links containing account credentials, sensitive account information, and other "interesting" content. Since its debut on April 3, it has captured more than 3,300 records containing 1.1 million addresses, most of which are accompanied by the plaintext or cryptographic hash of an associated password. The project has also unearthed social security and driver license numbers, credit card data, and other information that could be used to hijack user accounts or commit identity theft. On average, Dumpmon collects 51 such posts each day.</p>
<p>"It was mainly trying to determine how much information is being hidden from plain view and finding out how much information can be found just by looking in the right place," said Jordan Wright, a security engineer for <a href="http://www.conetrix.com/">CoNetrix</a>. (Wright created the Dumpmon as an independent side project.) "It's pretty incredible. I wasn't expecting as much information as I found. I was expecting a lot less for sure."</p>

In a conference call this afternoon, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Oracle President Mark Hurd discussed a partnership between the companies that will bring Oracle platforms—including Java middleware—into Microsoft's Azure cloud. </span></p>
<p>Oracle has moved to certify and support its products, including Oracle WebLogic, the Oracle database, and Oracle Linux, for Azure and Microsoft's Hyper-V hypervisor. "At the highest level, this partnership extends Oracle's support of Windows Server to also include Windows Hyper-V and Windows Azure as supported platforms," Ballmer said.</p>
<p>Oracle will provide full license mobility, Ballmer added, so that customers can move existing Oracle software licenses from on-premises physical or virtual servers to virtual servers on Hyper-V and in the Azure cloud. "There's an immediate benefit for our customers," he said. Support of Oracle's database and application server products, and of Oracle Linux, is available immediately starting today.</p>

 <p>Last year, the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/05/supreme-court-orders-do-over-on-key-software-patent-ruling/">Supreme Court ordered</a> the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to reconsider the validity of a patent that broadly covers the concept of Internet users watching advertisements in exchange for accessing copyrighted content.</p>
<p><a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%252Fnetahtml%252FPTO%252Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=7346545.PN.&amp;OS=PN/7346545&amp;RS=PN/7346545">US patent 7,346,545</a>, titled "Method and system for payment of intellectual property royalties by interposed sponsor on behalf of consumer over a telecommunications network," was granted to a company called Ultramercial and used to sue Hulu, YouTube, and a gaming company called WildTangent. Hulu and YouTube were dismissed from the case, while WildTangent had to fight on. WildTangent challenged Ultramercial's "invention" as being too abstract to qualify for patent protection, and the company won a ruling from US District Court in Central California dismissing the patent lawsuit.</p>
<p>The appeals court reversed the district court decision and remanded the case to that court. But the Supreme Court vacated the appeals court ruling, saying the online ad patent should be re-examined in light of a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/03/supreme-court-saves-medical-profession-from-diagnostic-patents/">previous Supreme Court decision</a>, which invalidated a patent that broadly covered a method for determining the proper dose of a drug used to treat autoimmune disorders. So the question of whether the patent was valid went to the appeals court again.</p>

 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-17e3ae9d-76fe-f3e1-d73f-460e48c704e3">During a Monday morning conference call, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said that National Security Agency (NSA) leaker Edward Snowden’s digital trove of leaked documents and materials was “secured by the relevant journalistic organizations prior to travel.”</p>
<p>Assange's comments could suggest that <em>The Guardian</em> and the <em>Washington Post</em>—where Snowden previously leaked information—are now in possession of his entire cache. Ars asked <em>The Guardian</em> and the <em>Post</em> to confirm this but did not receive an immediate reply.</p>

 <p>Jupiter's Great Red Spot may get most of the attention, but it's hardly the only big weather event in the Solar System. Saturn, for example, has an odd hexagonal pattern in the clouds at its north pole, and when the planet tilted enough to illuminate it, the light revealed <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-149">a giant hurricane</a> embedded in the center of the hexagon. Scientists think the immense storm may have been there for years.</p>
<p>But Saturn is also home to transient storms that show up sporadically. The most notable of these are the Great White Spots, which can persist for months and alter the weather on a planetary scale. Great White Spots are rare, with only six having been observed since 1876. When one formed in 2010, we were lucky enough to have the Cassini orbiter in place to watch it from close up. Even though the head of the storm was roughly 7,000 km across, Cassini's cameras were able to image it at resolutions where each pixel was only 14 km across, allowing an unprecedented view into the storm's dynamics.</p>
<p>The storm turned out to be very violent, with convective features as big as 3,000 km across that could form and dissipate in as little as 10 hours. Winds of over 400 km/hour were detected, and the pressure gradient between the storm and the unaffected areas nearby was twice that of the one observed in the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. By carefully mapping the direction of the winds, the authors were able to conclude that the head of the White Spot was an anti-cyclone, with winds orbiting around a central feature.</p>

<p>Samsung has introduced three different sizes of the Galaxy Tab 3 in the hopes that there's at least one that fits you just right. The company <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130624005824/en/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-3-Portfolio-Offers-Consumers">announced</a> today that its US customers will be able to buy a 7-inch tablet for $199, an 8-inch option for $299, or 10.1-inch option for $399.</p>
<p>Samsung writes that the "portfolio" of tablets is supposed to offer consumers "more options," but one could also view the move as the company hedging its bets. With a 7-inch model, for instance, Samsung can compete head-to-head with the ever-popular Asus Nexus 7 while also offering varying sizes for those who might want a larger form factor—or a choice over other similarly sized Android tablets.</p>
<p>Your choice is not limited to screen size, however. The Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 will <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/06/24/samsung-galaxy-tab-3-7-0-8-0-and-10-1-release-date-pricing/?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget">feature</a> a dual-core 1.2GHz processor, 8GB of storage with expandable memory, a 1024×600 resolution TFT display, and Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. The 8-inch variant features slightly better specifications, with an Exynos 1.5GHz dual-core processor with 1.5GB of RAM, a 1280×800 resolution TFT display, and Android 4.2 Jelly Bean, as well as a rear-facing 5-megapixel camera and 16GB of storage. The last of the family of new tablets borrows from each of its siblings, sporting the same resolution as the 8-inch Galaxy Tab 3 and the same camera specifications as the 7-inch model. The biggest difference is its Intel Z2560 1.6GHz dual-core processor, though it only has 1GB of RAM.</p>

 <p>Netflix has been a good citizen on GitHub the past couple of years, taking much of the software used to manage Netflix's IT infrastructure and <a href="https://github.com/Netflix">releasing it as open source</a>. Previously, Netflix open sourced a bit of software called "<a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/07/netflix-attacks-own-network-with-chaos-monkey-and-now-you-can-too/">Chaos Monkey,</a>" which randomly takes Amazon-based virtual machines offline so that Netflix engineers can identify problems before they harm customer experience.</p>
<p>Now, Netflix has released "<a href="https://github.com/Netflix/genie">Genie</a>," a platform-as-a-service tool that provides job and resource management for <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/01/the-big-disk-drive-in-the-sky-how-the-giants-of-the-web-store-big-data/">Hadoop clusters</a> on cloud services such as Amazon. The release under the Apache open source license was announced on <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/06/genie-is-out-of-bottle.html">Netflix's tech blog on Friday.</a> Netflix first described how Genie works <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/01/hadoop-platform-as-service-in-cloud.html">in January</a>, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amazon provides Hadoop Infrastructure as a Service, via their Elastic MapReduce (EMR) offering. EMR provides an API to provision and run Hadoop clusters (i.e. infrastructure), on which you can run one or more Hadoop jobs. We have implemented Hadoop Platform as a Service (called “Genie”), which provides a higher level of abstraction, where one can submit individual Hadoop, Hive, and Pig jobs via a REST-ful API without having to provision new Hadoop clusters, or installing any Hadoop, Hive, or Pig clients. Furthermore, it enables administrators to manage and abstract out configurations of various back-end Hadoop resources in the cloud.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://hive.apache.org/">Hive</a> and <a href="http://pig.apache.org/">Pig</a> are Apache Software Foundation projects that provide data warehouse infrastructure and MapReduce programs for Hadoop.</p>

It has taken quite a while, but it looks like there's finally movement happening on that front: just shy of four months after a five-year-old in the UK bought <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/03/five-year-old-runs-up-2500-in-app-purchase-tab-with-apple/">$2,500 worth of in-app bling</a>, Apple is releasing details about a <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2013/06/23/apple-notifies-itunes-users-of-in-app-purchase-settlement-details-5-to-those-inappropriately-charged-under-30/">class-action settlement</a> intended to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Details of the settlement can be found on <a href="https://www.itunesinapppurchasesettlement.com/CAClaimForms/AIL/Home.aspx">this site</a> (which, ironically, appears to be programmed in Microsoft ASP.NET and served on Microsoft IIS 7.5):</p>
<blockquote><p>If you are eligible for settlement benefits, you may choose between (a) a single $5 iTunes Store credit or (b) a credit equal to the total amount of Game Currency that a minor charged to your iTunes account without your knowledge or permission within a single forty-five (45) day period, less any refund you previously received. A cash refund in lieu of an iTunes Store credit is available if (a) you no longer have an active iTunes account, or (b) your claims exceed $30 in total. Additional requirements for claiming charges after the forty-five (45) day period apply.</p></blockquote>
<p>In typical class-action fashion, the settlement provides a small amount of remuneration in the form of a $5 iTunes gift card if you claim that a minor purchased less than $30 of unauthorized stuff; if you have more than $30 in unauthorized purchases, the settlement will provide some undefined amount of cash.</p>

 <p>Actress Ellen Page is not in <i>The Last of Us</i>, no matter how much it might look like she is, and she's lashing out publicly at developer Naughty Dog for "ripping off" her likeness for the game.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gxgfx/i_am_actress_ellen_page_amaa/caorlh8">an AMA interview on Reddit</a> last night, Page responded to a question about how Ellie both looks and sounds like Page, "so much so that almost everyone assumed it was you playing the role," according to the questioner. Page responded, "I guess I should be flattered that they ripped off my likeness, but I am actually acting in a video game called <i>Beyond: Two Souls</i>, so it was not appreciated."</p>
<p>It's true: the visual similarities between the real-life Page and the virtual Ellie have confused a <a href="https://twitter.com/ez50864/status/344689364636430336">few</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/JamieScoins/status/346051392147968000">people</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/pspcarlos/status/348958198314696705">on Twitter</a>. Page doesn't want the credit, though, sending one Twitter user toward <a href="https://twitter.com/TheVulcanSalute">Ellie's actual voice and mo-cap actress Ashley Johnson</a> in <a href="https://twitter.com/EllenPage/status/348961670833512449">a response tweet</a> just last night.</p>
