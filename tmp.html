 <p>Last November, an oddball news story caught attention around the world. A research vessel in the Coral Sea, northwest of Australia, discovered that a small island on the map didn’t actually, well, <i>exist</i>. It wasn’t a victim of sea level rise or a David Copperfield illusion—there just wasn’t anything there. A lot of the news coverage at the time was (quite appropriately) of the “Gee—whaddya know?” variety, but the researchers who “undiscovered” (<i>de-scovered?</i>) Sandy Island recently published a paper in <i>Eos </i>detailing answers to deeper questions—how did the island get on the map in the first place and what can we learn from its undiscovery?</p>
<p>The vessel, the RV <i>Southern Surveyor</i>, wasn’t out checking on islands to make sure they were still there. As University of Sydney PhD student Sabin Zahirovic told Ars, the research <a href="http://www.earthbyte.org/">group</a> on board was collecting measurements of the seafloor to aid in piecing together the plate tectonic history of the Coral Sea region, which is poorly understood. That included things like seafloor depth, magnetism (magnetic signatures are locked into the rock as it cools from magma at mid-ocean ridges), gravity measurements (which detect variations in rock density), and good old-fashioned rock samples.</p>
<p>It was with that work on their mind that they noticed something odd. “Close to New Caledonia, we noticed this blob that represented Sandy Island on our scientific charts,” Zahirovic said. “At that time we were unaware of the island's name because it did not appear in the main navigational chart, but only in our scientific charts and cached version of Google Earth.”</p>

 <p>There’s a saying—"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_ain%27t_no_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch">there’s no such thing as a free lunch</a>." On the Web, however, it sure <em>seems</em> like there is. In the time span of a lunch break, a few keywords in a search engine promise free entertainment, just several clicks away. We all know the catch though. These freebies can come with freeloading adware, malware, and other unwanted programs and plugins. This was particularly true in the Internet’s early days, but in the past decade tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo—the three major players in search today—have deployed significant resources to prevent adware and malware compromising their Web browsers, e-mail services, and websites. It can't be that bad in 2013, right?</p>
<p>Answering this question required a little experiment, one inspired by the documentary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_size_me"><em>Super-Size Me</em></a>. That film chronicles Morgan Spurlock’s month-long fast food “diet” during which he limited his exercise and knowledge about healthy eating, had to order everything on the McDonald’s menu at least once, and never said no to an upgrade offer.</p>

<p>The Web version of this is simpler and better for an individual's (physical) health. From a clean computer fresh off an OS install, enter some of the most popular, plausible generic free keyword searches on a popular Web browser. Next, open all of the links in the search results (ads and otherwise) and download the first thing on the landing pages, recording where it went and what it did. Like Spurlock, I would limit my knowledge about what was safe or risky and take no (Internet) precautions beyond the default settings. The same rules applied for installing the program afterward. And in the Web's version of "want fries with that?" I had to say yes to whatever was offered. There would be no avoiding a Web culture of excess and extras.</p>

<div id="spec3" style="display: none"><div id="rss-wrap">

</div>
 <p><b>UPDATE:</b> Microsoft sent along this statement in response to a request from Ars Technica.</p>
<blockquote><p>Xbox One does not include a pack-in headset accessory. Each Xbox One includes the new Kinect sensor, with a highly sensitive multi-array microphones designed to enable voice inputs and chat as a system-level capability, both in-game and with Skype and other experiences. For gamers who prefer a headset, we have a variety of offerings that you can find on the <a href="http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/e3-accessories">Xbox Wire</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>ORIGINAL STORY</b></p>
<p>Amid the fallout from an explosive E3 earlier this month, Microsoft quietly revealed some of the official accessories that will be released alongside the Xbox One in November. On this list was <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/headsets/chat-headset">a one-ear mono headset</a> that seems relatively unremarkable except for one well-hidden fact: it apparently will not be included in the box with the Xbox One.</p>

<div id="spec4" style="display: none"><div id="rss-wrap">
<div>

 <p>For the most part, crop rotation—planting different produce in different years—is advertised as a way of helping the soil by keeping a single crop from draining it of some types of nutrients. But it turns out that crop rotation can also help control some agricultural pests. Many pests are specialized feeders that grow on a limited number of plants. Place a distantly related species in the same field, and the pests find themselves with nothing to eat. By the time the original crop rotates back into the field, the bugs that specialize in feeding on it are long since dead.</p>
<p>This approach helped effectively control the western corn rootworm. As its name implies, the animal specializes in eating corn (as the name <em>doesn't</em> imply, it's actually a beetle). By alternating corn and soybeans in the same field, the corn rootworm ended up spending every other year with nothing to eat, keeping its numbers in check. Unfortunately, Illinois has seen the appearance of a "rotation resistant" strain, which is now spreading more widely across the US.</p>
<p>How does an insect become resistant to the fact that its normal meal vanishes? Scientists are beginning to crack the problem, and they're finding it's a combination of changes in the corn rootworm itself, plus changes to the ecosystem it carries along in its gut.</p>

 <p>Apple's <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/06/new-haswell-based-macbook-airs-offer-faster-graphics-all-day-battery-life/">2013 MacBook Air</a> doesn't look like much of an upgrade from the outside, but the story is different on the inside. We've spent the better part of a week using the new Air and measuring just how <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/06/the-u-is-for-ultrabook-intels-low-power-dual-core-haswell-cpus-unveiled/">Intel's new Haswell processors</a>, the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/06/ifixit-finds-a-plethora-of-minor-tweaks-inside-the-2013-macbook-air/">PCI Express-based SSD</a>, and the 802.11ac Wi-Fi adapter change the laptop compared to last year's model.</p>
<p>The new Wi-Fi chip was the change that I was the most eager to get my hands on. I'm always looking to boost my network speeds, but I've been waiting for hardware based on the new 802.11ac standard to become more widely available before upgrading everything on my network. Reviewing both the new Air and Apple's new 802.11ac-capable Airport Express Base Station simultaneously would give me a chance to see just how close the lauded "Gigabit Wi-Fi" would come to fulfilling its promises. I was unpleasantly surprised by the results.</p>
<p>Both the 2012 and 2013 MacBook Airs use four antennas to transmit data—two to send data and two to receive it. Each set of antennas can theoretically send and receive 150Mbps (or 18.75MBps) using 5GHz 802.11n for a total of 300Mbps (37.5MBps). Under 802.11ac, the size of each stream is increased to 433Mbps, making for a maximum theoretical link speed of 866Mbps (108.25MBps) in the 2013 MacBook Air. Actual network transfer speeds rarely (if ever) come within spitting distance of these theoretical maximums, but we would at least expect the actual 802.11ac transfer speeds to increase by a similar percentage compared to 802.11n.</p>

 <p>Password and credit-card details leak online every day. So no one really knows just how much personally identifiable information is available by clicking on the right link to <a href="http://pastebin.com/">Pastebin</a>, <a href="http://pastie.org/">Pastie</a>, or similar sites. Using a platform that runs on the hobbyist <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> platform to drink from this fire hose, a security researcher has cataloged more than 3,000 such posts in less than three months while adding scores more each week.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dumpmon">Dumpmon</a>, as the <a href="http://raidersec.blogspot.com/2013/03/introducing-dumpmon-twitter-bot-that.html">project is called</a>, is a bot that monitors Twitter messages for Web links containing account credentials, sensitive account information, and other "interesting" content. Since its debut on April 3, it has captured more than 3,300 records containing 1.1 million addresses, most of which are accompanied by the plaintext or cryptographic hash of an associated password. The project has also unearthed social security and driver license numbers, credit card data, and other information that could be used to hijack user accounts or commit identity theft. On average, Dumpmon collects 51 such posts each day.</p>
<p>"It was mainly trying to determine how much information is being hidden from plain view and finding out how much information can be found just by looking in the right place," said Jordan Wright, a security engineer for <a href="http://www.conetrix.com/">CoNetrix</a>. (Wright created the Dumpmon as an independent side project.) "It's pretty incredible. I wasn't expecting as much information as I found. I was expecting a lot less for sure."</p>

In a conference call this afternoon, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Oracle President Mark Hurd discussed a partnership between the companies that will bring Oracle platforms—including Java middleware—into Microsoft's Azure cloud. </span></p>
<p>Oracle has moved to certify and support its products, including Oracle WebLogic, the Oracle database, and Oracle Linux, for Azure and Microsoft's Hyper-V hypervisor. "At the highest level, this partnership extends Oracle's support of Windows Server to also include Windows Hyper-V and Windows Azure as supported platforms," Ballmer said.</p>
<p>Oracle will provide full license mobility, Ballmer added, so that customers can move existing Oracle software licenses from on-premises physical or virtual servers to virtual servers on Hyper-V and in the Azure cloud. "There's an immediate benefit for our customers," he said. Support of Oracle's database and application server products, and of Oracle Linux, is available immediately starting today.</p>

 <p>Last year, the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/05/supreme-court-orders-do-over-on-key-software-patent-ruling/">Supreme Court ordered</a> the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to reconsider the validity of a patent that broadly covers the concept of Internet users watching advertisements in exchange for accessing copyrighted content.</p>
<p><a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%252Fnetahtml%252FPTO%252Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=7346545.PN.&amp;OS=PN/7346545&amp;RS=PN/7346545">US patent 7,346,545</a>, titled "Method and system for payment of intellectual property royalties by interposed sponsor on behalf of consumer over a telecommunications network," was granted to a company called Ultramercial and used to sue Hulu, YouTube, and a gaming company called WildTangent. Hulu and YouTube were dismissed from the case, while WildTangent had to fight on. WildTangent challenged Ultramercial's "invention" as being too abstract to qualify for patent protection, and the company won a ruling from US District Court in Central California dismissing the patent lawsuit.</p>
<p>The appeals court reversed the district court decision and remanded the case to that court. But the Supreme Court vacated the appeals court ruling, saying the online ad patent should be re-examined in light of a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/03/supreme-court-saves-medical-profession-from-diagnostic-patents/">previous Supreme Court decision</a>, which invalidated a patent that broadly covered a method for determining the proper dose of a drug used to treat autoimmune disorders. So the question of whether the patent was valid went to the appeals court again.</p>

Saturn, for example, has an odd hexagonal pattern in the clouds at its north pole, and when the planet tilted enough to illuminate it, the light revealed <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-149">a giant hurricane</a> embedded in the center of the hexagon. Scientists think the immense storm may have been there for years.</p>
<p>But Saturn is also home to transient storms that show up sporadically. The most notable of these are the Great White Spots, which can persist for months and alter the weather on a planetary scale. Great White Spots are rare, with only six having been observed since 1876. When one formed in 2010, we were lucky enough to have the Cassini orbiter in place to watch it from close up. Even though the head of the storm was roughly 7,000 km across, Cassini's cameras were able to image it at resolutions where each pixel was only 14 km across, allowing an unprecedented view into the storm's dynamics.</p>
<p>The storm turned out to be very violent, with convective features as big as 3,000 km across that could form and dissipate in as little as 10 hours. Winds of over 400 km/hour were detected, and the pressure gradient between the storm and the unaffected areas nearby was twice that of the one observed in the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. By carefully mapping the direction of the winds, the authors were able to conclude that the head of the White Spot was an anti-cyclone, with winds orbiting around a central feature.</p>

<p>Samsung has introduced three different sizes of the Galaxy Tab 3 in the hopes that there's at least one that fits you just right. The company <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130624005824/en/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-3-Portfolio-Offers-Consumers">announced</a> today that its US customers will be able to buy a 7-inch tablet for $199, an 8-inch option for $299, or 10.1-inch option for $399.</p>
<p>Samsung writes that the "portfolio" of tablets is supposed to offer consumers "more options," but one could also view the move as the company hedging its bets. With a 7-inch model, for instance, Samsung can compete head-to-head with the ever-popular Asus Nexus 7 while also offering varying sizes for those who might want a larger form factor—or a choice over other similarly sized Android tablets.</p>
<p>Your choice is not limited to screen size, however. The Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 will <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/06/24/samsung-galaxy-tab-3-7-0-8-0-and-10-1-release-date-pricing/?utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=Feed_Classic&amp;utm_campaign=Engadget">feature</a> a dual-core 1.2GHz processor, 8GB of storage with expandable memory, a 1024×600 resolution TFT display, and Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. The 8-inch variant features slightly better specifications, with an Exynos 1.5GHz dual-core processor with 1.5GB of RAM, a 1280×800 resolution TFT display, and Android 4.2 Jelly Bean, as well as a rear-facing 5-megapixel camera and 16GB of storage. The last of the family of new tablets borrows from each of its siblings, sporting the same resolution as the 8-inch Galaxy Tab 3 and the same camera specifications as the 7-inch model. The biggest difference is its Intel Z2560 1.6GHz dual-core processor, though it only has 1GB of RAM.</p>

 <p>Netflix has been a good citizen on GitHub the past couple of years, taking much of the software used to manage Netflix's IT infrastructure and <a href="https://github.com/Netflix">releasing it as open source</a>. Previously, Netflix open sourced a bit of software called "<a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/07/netflix-attacks-own-network-with-chaos-monkey-and-now-you-can-too/">Chaos Monkey,</a>" which randomly takes Amazon-based virtual machines offline so that Netflix engineers can identify problems before they harm customer experience.</p>
<p>Now, Netflix has released "<a href="https://github.com/Netflix/genie">Genie</a>," a platform-as-a-service tool that provides job and resource management for <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/01/the-big-disk-drive-in-the-sky-how-the-giants-of-the-web-store-big-data/">Hadoop clusters</a> on cloud services such as Amazon. The release under the Apache open source license was announced on <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/06/genie-is-out-of-bottle.html">Netflix's tech blog on Friday.</a> Netflix first described how Genie works <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/01/hadoop-platform-as-service-in-cloud.html">in January</a>, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amazon provides Hadoop Infrastructure as a Service, via their Elastic MapReduce (EMR) offering. EMR provides an API to provision and run Hadoop clusters (i.e. infrastructure), on which you can run one or more Hadoop jobs. We have implemented Hadoop Platform as a Service (called “Genie”), which provides a higher level of abstraction, where one can submit individual Hadoop, Hive, and Pig jobs via a REST-ful API without having to provision new Hadoop clusters, or installing any Hadoop, Hive, or Pig clients. Furthermore, it enables administrators to manage and abstract out configurations of various back-end Hadoop resources in the cloud.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://hive.apache.org/">Hive</a> and <a href="http://pig.apache.org/">Pig</a> are Apache Software Foundation projects that provide data warehouse infrastructure and MapReduce programs for Hadoop.</p>

<div id="spec14" style="display: none"><div id="rss-wrap"> <p>Back in <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/02/ftc-says-it-will-look-into-apples-marketing-of-in-app-purchases-to-kids/">2011</a>, the Federal Trade Commission promised to look into the controls Apple had in place to prevent minors from making in-app purchases on iOS games. It has taken quite a while, but it looks like there's finally movement happening on that front: just shy of four months after a five-year-old in the UK bought <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2013/03/five-year-old-runs-up-2500-in-app-purchase-tab-with-apple/">$2,500 worth of in-app bling</a>, Apple is releasing details about a <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2013/06/23/apple-notifies-itunes-users-of-in-app-purchase-settlement-details-5-to-those-inappropriately-charged-under-30/">class-action settlement</a> intended to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Details of the settlement can be found on <a href="https://www.itunesinapppurchasesettlement.com/CAClaimForms/AIL/Home.aspx">this site</a> (which, ironically, appears to be programmed in Microsoft ASP.NET and served on Microsoft IIS 7.5):</p>
<blockquote><p>If you are eligible for settlement benefits, you may choose between (a) a single $5 iTunes Store credit or (b) a credit equal to the total amount of Game Currency that a minor charged to your iTunes account without your knowledge or permission within a single forty-five (45) day period, less any refund you previously received. A cash refund in lieu of an iTunes Store credit is available if (a) you no longer have an active iTunes account, or (b) your claims exceed $30 in total. Additional requirements for claiming charges after the forty-five (45) day period apply.</p></blockquote>
<p>In typical class-action fashion, the settlement provides a small amount of remuneration in the form of a $5 iTunes gift card if you claim that a minor purchased less than $30 of unauthorized stuff; if you have more than $30 in unauthorized purchases, the settlement will provide some undefined amount of cash.</p>

 <p>Actress Ellen Page is not in <i>The Last of Us</i>, no matter how much it might look like she is, and she's lashing out publicly at developer Naughty Dog for "ripping off" her likeness for the game.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gxgfx/i_am_actress_ellen_page_amaa/caorlh8">an AMA interview on Reddit</a> last night, Page responded to a question about how Ellie both looks and sounds like Page, "so much so that almost everyone assumed it was you playing the role," according to the questioner. Page responded, "I guess I should be flattered that they ripped off my likeness, but I am actually acting in a video game called <i>Beyond: Two Souls</i>, so it was not appreciated."</p>
<p>It's true: the visual similarities between the real-life Page and the virtual Ellie have confused a <a href="https://twitter.com/ez50864/status/344689364636430336">few</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/JamieScoins/status/346051392147968000">people</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/pspcarlos/status/348958198314696705">on Twitter</a>. Page doesn't want the credit, though, sending one Twitter user toward <a href="https://twitter.com/TheVulcanSalute">Ellie's actual voice and mo-cap actress Ashley Johnson</a> in <a href="https://twitter.com/EllenPage/status/348961670833512449">a response tweet</a> just last night.</p>

 <p>You've got an Android phone, an Android tablet, and maybe even an Android laptop, but be honest with yourself: your affection for Google's mobile operating system knows no bounds, and you won't rest until it's powering literally every computer you own. If this description fits you, HP's newly announced Slate 21 is for you. It's a 21.5-inch, 1920×1080 kickstand-toting all-in-one equipped with Nvidia's Tegra 4 SoC and running Android 4.2.2.</p>
<p>We don't know much more about the all-in-one, which was announced this morning at an HP event in Beijing, but according to Engadget's <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/06/24/hp-launches-slate-21-aio/">translated version of the press release</a>, it also includes an HD webcam, integrated speakers, and HP's <a href="http://www.hp.com/global/us/en/wireless/wireless-direct.html">Wireless Direct</a> printing tech. We don't know anything about pricing, availability, or whether the desktop will even come to the US, but CNET <a href="http://asia.cnet.com/hp-slate-21-aio-is-a-21-inch-android-tablet-62221673.htm?src=twt">reports</a> that it will be rolled out to multiple countries eventually.</p>
<p>Perhaps in an effort to offer cheaper machines without expensive Windows licenses or Intel processors, the PC OEMs are increasingly beginning to experiment with Android in form factors one wouldn't normally expect. The HP Slate 21 follows the previously announced <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/ads/x2/slatebook-x2.html">HP Slate x2</a> convertible laptop, which is itself reminiscent of Asus' long-running <a href="http://eee.asus.com/en/transformer-300/features">Transformer Pad</a> series. Asus is also responsible for a few other Android-equipped curios, including both an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/03/asus-1299-transformer-all-in-one-dual-wields-windows-8-and-android/">all-in-one computer</a> and an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/06/two-cpus-two-batteries-two-oses-asus-announces-transformer-book-trio/">upcoming laptop</a> that have full Android tablets inside their detachable screens.</p>

<div id="spec17" style="display: none"><div id="rss-wrap"> <p>After spending the night in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport, NSA leaker Edward Snowden <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/24/edward-snowden-booked-on-plane-from-moscow-to-havana-live-coverage">did not board</a> the Aeroflot flight he had been expected to take to Havana. His plan was apparently to fly to the Cuban capital and then to go <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/06/with-wikileaks-help-snowden-lands-in-moscow-headed-on-to-democratic-nation/">on to Ecuador (where he had requested asylum)</a>. Snowden's whereabouts remain unknown.</p>
<p>It may be that Snowden and his friends from WikiLeaks—who helped him secure a “special refugee travel document” last week from Ecuadorian authorities and assisted with his trip from Hong Kong to Moscow—have an alternate travel route in mind. There is also the possibility that he is being detained by Russian authorities.</p>
<p>The State Department had revoked Snowden’s American passport on Friday, which is normal for persons with “<a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/06/united-states-charges-snowden-with-espionage-asks-hong-kong-to-arrest-him/">felony arrest warrants</a>.”</p>

 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-6e8b37c8-58b1-d128-4f5a-cbd703767b18">Fifteen years ago, I was living outside Geneva, Switzerland, spending my lunch hours screwing around on the nascent Web a few dozen kilometers from where it was created. I popped into chat rooms, forums, and news sites, and I e-mailed family back home. I was learning French and getting my dose of tech news by reading the French-language edition of <em>Macworld</em> magazine. (<em>Génial</em>!)</p>
<p>I returned Stateside mere months after Ars began, reading more and more about the people behind many of the technologies that I was becoming increasingly fascinated with. I consumed just about every book I could find describing the history and personalities behind graphical user interfaces, networking, the Internet itself, and more.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing I’ve learned through all that, it’s that most people involved in technology continue the Newtonian tradition of humility. The most iconic innovators all seem to readily acknowledge that they stand on the shoulders of giants. In fact, when I met Vint Cerf and thanked him for making the work I do possible, he was a predictable gentleman, saying, “There were many others involved in the creation of TCP/IP, not just me.”</p>

 <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-6e8b37c8-6862-c13f-4d20-b634252b39cd">According to <a href="http://www.chetansharma.com/usmarketupdateq12013.htm">new industry data published last week from the mobile phone industry</a>, three major shifts are currently underway in the American cellular landscape. We’re spending record amounts on mobile data, carriers are making <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/06/prepaid-mobile-phone-users-in-america-hit-record-high/">hardly any money off new subscribers (hence the push toward data)</a>, and usage of Internet-based messaging systems is going through the roof.</p>
<p>With that first shift, according to independent analyst Chetan Sharma, mobile data now accounts for “almost 45 percent of the US mobile industry services revenues, and as we had forecasted a few years back, the cross-over point of 50 percent might occur later this year.”</p>
<p>So you’re not just imagining things—your mobile phone bill is creeping upward. Likely, it’s due to the fact that on your smartphone, you’re using data far more than texting and texting far more than calling.</p>

<div id="spec20" style="display: none"><div id="rss-wrap"> <p>California's Department of Financial Institutions has issued a cease and desist letter to the Bitcoin Foundation for "allegedly engaging in the business of money transmission without a license or proper authorization," <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmatonis/2013/06/23/bitcoin-foundation-receives-cease-and-desist-order-from-california/">according to <em>Forbes</em></a>. The news comes after Bitcoin held its <a href="http://www.bitcoin2013.com/">"Future of Payments" conference</a> in San Jose last month. (The license information is available on <a href="http://dfi.ca.gov/Licensees/money_transmitter/default.html">CA.gov</a> and <em>Forbes</em> placed the cease and desist letter on <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/149335233/CA-State-Cease-and-Desist-May-30">Scribd</a>.)</p>
<p>If found in violation, penalties range from $1,000 to $2,500 per violation per day plus criminal prosecution (which could lead to more fines and possibly imprisonment). Under federal law, it's also a felony "to engage in the business of money transmission without the appropriate state license or failure to register with the US Treasury Department," according to <em>Forbes</em>. Penalties under that law could be up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</p>
<p>Jon Matonis, a member of the Bitcoin Foundation's Board of Directors, wrote up the news for <em>Forbes</em>. Matonis defended the Bitcoin Foundation's actions during its time in California:</p>

<div id="spec21" style="display: none"><div id="rss-wrap"> <p>Last October, Ars published an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/10/epa-fracking-investigation-in-wyoming-revisited-after-objections/">update</a> to a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2011/12/how-the-epa-linked-fracking-to-contaminated-well-water/">US EPA investigation</a> linking natural gas production to groundwater contamination in Wyoming. On Thursday, the EPA <a href="http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/0/DC7DCDB471DCFE1785257B90007377BF">announced</a> that it will step back from the investigation, ceding leadership to the State of Wyoming.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://deq.state.wy.us/">Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality</a> and the <a href="http://wogcc.state.wy.us/">Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission</a> will further investigate groundwater conditions around Pavillion with support from the EPA, according to the press release. The scope of the investigation will be more limited, however. It'll now focus on a select number of private wells rather than larger questions about the possibility of gas production and hydraulic fracking impacts in shallow and deep groundwater. The State plans to additionally sample fourteen water supply wells, analyze existing data on the cement seals in gas production wells within a quarter mile of those water wells, and search for records of previous wastewater pits used to hold fracking fluid in that area. The results are scheduled to be finalized and released in September 2014.</p>
<p>Some of that work will be paid for with funds from a $1.5 million grant that Encana, the gas exploration company operating in Pavillion, is giving to the <a href="http://www.conservewy.com/wnrf/">Wyoming Natural Resource Foundation</a>.</p>

 <p>New York City noise blares right outside Tumblr’s office in the Flat Iron District in Manhattan. Once inside, the headquarters hum with a quiet intensity. I am surrounded by four dogs that employees have brought to the workspace today. Apparently, there are even more dogs lurking somewhere behind the perpendicular rows of desks. What makes the whole thing even spookier is that these dogs don’t bark or growl. It’s like someone’s told them that there are developers and designers at work, and somehow they’ve taken the cue.</p>
<p>I’m here to see Tumblr’s Creative Director Peter Vidani who is going to pull the curtain back on the design process and user experience at Tumblr. And when I say design process, I don’t just mean color schemes or typefaces. I am here to see the process of interaction design: how the team at Tumblr comes up with ideas for the user interface on its website and its mobile apps. I want to find out how those ideas are shaped <span style="font-size: 14px;">into a final product </span><span style="font-size: 14px;">by their engineering team.</span></p>
<p>Back in May, Yahoo announced it was <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/05/yahoo-will-purchase-tumblr-for-1-1-billion-according-to-wsj-report/">acquiring Tumblr for $1.1 billion</a>. Yahoo indicated that Tumblr would continue to operate independently, though we will probably see a lot of content crossover between the millions of blog posts hosted by Tumblr and Yahoo’s search engine technology. It’s a little known fact that Yahoo has provided some useful tools for UX professionals and developers over the years through their <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/">Design Pattern Library</a>, which shares some of Yahoo’s most successful and time-tested UI touches and interactions with Web developers. It’s probably too early to tell if Tumblr’s UI elements will filter back into these libraries. In the meantime, I talked to Vidani about how Tumblr UI features come to life.</p>

<div id="spec23" style="display: none"><div id="rss-wrap"> <figure class="video" style="width:640px"><iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gcL3_zzgWeU#?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0"></iframe><div class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">
<div class="caption-text">At the top of WhiteHouse.gov today, "Take Action on Climate Change."</div> </div></figure><p>On Tuesday at Georgetown University, President Barack Obama plans to deliver on his biggest promise from the 2013 inaugural address. "In my inaugural address, I pledged that America would respond to the growing threat of climate change for our children and future generations," the president states in a new video on WhiteHouse.gov. So this week, he'll lay out his vision of where the US needs to go with "a national plan to reduce carbon pollution, prep our country for the impacts of climate change, and lead global efforts to fight it."</p>
<p>Obama <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/us/politics/climate-change-prominent-in-obamas-inaugural-address.html?_r=0">made headlines</a> back in January for, among other things, making a bold, public promise for climate change policy. He devoted eight sentences of his inauguration speech to climate change—more than any other topic noted the <em>New York Times—</em>and did not sugarcoat it at the time. “Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science," Obama said. "But none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms.”</p>
<p>In this new teaser video, Obama recognizes there is "n<strong></strong>o single step that can reverse the effects of climate change." He makes reference to the need for collaborative work from scientists and farmers, engineers and businesses, and all US citizens and employees alike. However, the video doesn't reveal any specifics. It leads to the <a href="http://whitehouse.gov/climate-change">WhiteHouse.gov/climate-change</a> page, which does the same.</p>

 <p>In my <a title="Get Lamp Review" href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/09/the-great-thing-about/">review of <em>Get Lamp</em></a>, the documentary about text adventures, I mentioned that the original Infocom employees believed the market for these games could exist for hundreds of years. After all, the novel is still around today and, despite stiff competition from movies and video games, writing fiction is still a profitable endeavor. Why not interactive fiction?</p>
<p>The reality, however, is that since the demise of Infocom in 1989, many people have tried to make interactive fiction into a commercial endeavor. None have been able to figure out how to make the financial side work—until recently. Everything changed with the rise of smartphones and tablets.</p>
<h2>A new platform, a new type of game</h2>
<p>Michael Berlyn was an “implementor” at Infocom in the early 1980s and was responsible for hit games such as <em>Suspended</em> and <em>Infidel</em>. He left the company in 1984 before it imploded and went on to a successful career in game design and consulting. Berlyn created the <em>Bubsy</em> side-scrolling games on the Sega Genesis and contributed to <em>Syphon Filter</em> on the original PlayStation. He later retired from the industry and moved to Florida with his wife, Muffy. But when he saw the first iPhone, he knew there was a chance to create something new.</p>

 <p>For many low-volume Kenyan farmers, the only source of information about the market rate for crops comes from the very people who are trying to buy them. The lack of pricing transparency means that farmers don't always get the best deal. <a href="http://mfarm.co.ke/about">MFarm</a> seeks to solve this problem by providing up-to-date market prices via an app or SMS direct to farmers. It also connects farmers with buyers directly, cutting out the middlemen.</p>
<p>MFarm's CEO is Jamila Abass, a 29-year-old computer scientist from Kenya. She founded MFarm in 2010 after reading about how farmers have been "oppressed for decades and disconnected in terms of information."</p>
<p>"Many farmers only have the produce but don't have the means to market their produce themselves," Abass told Wired.co.uk. "They have to rely on middlemen who show up and give them both the price and the buyer. They have no information and no alternative market. We wanted to close that information gap between the farmers and the market."</p>
